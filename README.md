# CurrencyConverter
This is a remake of the Google currency converter using exchangerates.io API

I am trying to learn more regarding API interaction in web applications. This is just a fun small project for me to learn more and refine some of my skills in this area. The logic is pretty simple and straightforward, I used JavaScript for the main logic and local storage to hold the objects throughout the program.

Software Used:
* Web Languages
  - HTML - Mix of Hardcoding and dynamic loading
  - Custom CSS
  
* Client-Side Languages
  - Custom JS / jQuery
  - JSON
  - Local Storage
  
* APIs
  - Exchange Rates API io
  - https://exchangeratesapi.io/

**** I didn't really include much validation in regards to the input received from the user. That is something that I may go back to later, but it wasn't the focus of the project.
